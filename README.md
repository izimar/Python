# Python
These are personal projects that I have worked on to build on my skills and knowledge!

## Flask Chat App
This is a chat app that allows users to commuincate live to other users using web sockets. Not only that, but I also got to get more practice using html, css, javascript, python, and flask.  

##### Requirements:   Python 3.11.2, Flask 2.2.3, Werkzeug 2.2.3

##### Instructions:
You can test the connectivity of the app by visiting it on multiple browsers and creating more than one user. Copy the room code at the top of the chat box to enter mutiple users into one chat room.
